            Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the most celebrated festivals in India. Known as the "Festival of Lights," 
            it symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. The word "Deepavali" comes from the Sanskrit words 
            "Deepa" (lamp) and "Avali" (row), meaning a row of lamps. During this festival, homes, streets, and marketplaces are 
            decorated with earthen lamps, candles, and colorful electric lights.
        </p>
        <p>
            Diwali is celebrated over five days, with each day having its own significance. The first day, Dhanteras, marks the 
            beginning of the festival and is considered auspicious for buying gold, silver, and utensils. The second day, Naraka 
            Chaturdashi or Chhoti Diwali, commemorates the victory of Lord Krishna over the demon Narakasura. The third day, 
            the main Diwali day, honors the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after a 14-year exile and his victory over Ravana. 
            People light diyas and burst fireworks to celebrate. The fourth day is Govardhan Puja, and the fifth day, Bhai Dooj, 
            celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from lighting lamps and bursting crackers, Diwali is also a time for cleaning and decorating homes, exchanging 
            gifts, wearing new clothes, and preparing special sweets like laddoos, barfis, and gulab jamuns. Markets are full of 
            festive energy, with stalls selling everything from decorative items to delicious snacks. Families gather to worship 
            Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, seeking blessings for the coming year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Diwali is not just celebrated in India but also in many other parts of the world where Indian communities live. It 
            brings people together, strengthens bonds, and spreads happiness. The festival teaches the importance of hope, 
            kindness, and positivity. Truly, Diwali is more than just a festival—it is a feeling of joy, unity, and light.
